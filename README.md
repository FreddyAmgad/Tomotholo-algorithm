# Tomotholo-algorithm
“main.cpp” is a C++ program that implements an architectural simulator capable of assessing the
performance of a simplified out-of-order 16-bit RISC processor that uses Tomasulo’s algorithm 
without
speculation. The program reads instructions from a file, simulates the execution of these 
instructions using the Tomasulo Algorithm, and prints the results.
